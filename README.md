# Barbell-Exercises-Project---jupyter-notebooks

This repository contains the interactive jupyter notebooks that I have used along the project that created a ML model that recognizes a barbell exercise and counts the amount of reps. They display the process in a more thorough way, also showing the errors and issues that I have encountered along the project. I have not included them inside the project repository because they are too big and take up a lot of space.
